> There is no large codebase in any language that has zero accidental complexity. There are awkward bugfixes. There are workarounds. There are mitigations.
> There are many many reasons why the code which is useful won't be pure and beautiful 💻🐞🤔

> Changeability is the only design metric that matters; code that's easy to change is well-designed 🛠️🔄🎨

> Like many human endeavors, design is part art, part engineering, and part guesswork and experimentation. Discipline, hard work, inspiration, and sound technique all play their parts 🎨🧑‍💻🔬🧪

> Mak­ing even a sim­ple change to a mono­lith­ic code­base is pret­ty hard because you must under­stand the entire thing very well. Mak­ing changes to small­er, well-defined mod­ules is much easier 💡💻🤔
 
 > Do what you feel in your heart to be right – for you’ll be criticized anyway 💖🙏🗣️
