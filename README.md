#### A bit about me
My name is `Tien Do`. I am currently working as a `Ruby on Rails software developer`. `Ruby` is one of my first programming languages, and I feel `lucky` that I found it because its amazing `freedom` and `expressive` syntax just gets along with me so well (`thanks Matsumoto` and `all other phenomenal developers` who have spent lots of effort to develop this fanstatic porgramming language)

`Ruby on Rails` is built on top of Ruby and I do enjoy Ruby, so you can understand how much I enjoy Ruby on Rails

My current goals are to become a `better Ruby on Rails software developer every day` and `contribute back to the open source community in the near future`
