#### A bit about me
My name is Tien Do. I am currently working as a Ruby on Rails software developer. Ruby is one of my first programming languages, and I feel lucky that I found it because its unique `freedom` and `expressive` syntax gets along with me so well (thanks Matsumoto and all other phenomenal developers who have spent lots of effort to develop this fantastic programming language)

Ruby on Rails is built on top of Ruby, and I enjoy Ruby, so you can understand how much I want Ruby on Rails.

My current goals are to become a `better Ruby on Rails software developer every day` and `contribute back to the open source community soon.`

> There is no large codebase in any language that has zero accidental complexity. There are awkward bugfixes. There are workarounds. There are mitigations.
> There are many many reasons why the code which is useful won't be pure and beautiful.

> Changeability is the only design metric that matters; code that's easy to change is well-designed

> Like many human endeavors, design is part art, part engineering, and part guesswork and experimentation. Discipline, hard work, inspiration, and sound technique all play their parts

> Mak­ing even a sim­ple change to a mono­lith­ic code­base is pret­ty hard because you must under­stand the entire thing very well. Mak­ing changes to small­er, well-defined mod­ules is much easier.
 
 > Do what you feel in your heart to be right – for you’ll be criticized anyway.
